Eligible subjects will receive APG-2575 600mg, orally administered once daily (QD), within half an hour of a low-fat meal, for a cycle of 28 days. Participants will continue to accept APG - 2575 until the \"end of treatment\" that are consistent with the provisions in the solution of the termination of any specified standards."
