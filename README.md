## ‚ú® Features

This server is built on the [`mcp-ts-template`](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template) and inherits its rich feature set:

- **Declarative Tools**: Define agent capabilities in single, self-contained files. The framework handles registration, validation, and execution.
- **Robust Error Handling**: A unified `McpError` system ensures consistent, structured error responses.
- **Pluggable Authentication**: Secure your server with zero-fuss support for `none`, `jwt`, or `oauth` modes.
- **Abstracted Storage**: Swap storage backends (`in-memory`, `filesystem`, `Supabase`, `Cloudflare KV/R2`) without changing business logic.
- **Full-Stack Observability**: Deep insights with structured logging (Pino) and optional, auto-instrumented OpenTelemetry for traces and metrics.
- **Dependency Injection**: Built with `tsyringe` for a clean, decoupled, and testable architecture.
- **Edge-Ready**: Write code once and run it seamlessly on your local machine or at the edge on Cloudflare Workers.

Plus, specialized features for **ClinicalTrials.gov**:

- **Official API Integration**: Type-safe, comprehensive access to the ClinicalTrials.gov v2 API.
- **Advanced Search & Analysis**: Tools for complex queries, filtering, and statistical aggregation of trial data.
- **Optimized Data Handling**: Automatic cleaning and simplification of API responses for efficient agent consumption.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Agent Development Guide

For strict rules when using this server with an AI agent, refer to the **`.clinerules`** file in this repository. Key principles include:

- **Logic Throws, Handlers Catch**: Never use `try/catch` in your tool `logic`. Throw an `McpError` instead.
- **Pass the Context**: Always pass the `RequestContext` object through your call stack for logging and tracing.
- **Use the Barrel Exports**: Register new tools and resources only in the `index.ts` barrel files within their respective `definitions` directories.
