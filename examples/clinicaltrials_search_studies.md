- **NCT ID:** NCT06782724
- **Title:** Psilocybin Therapy for Psychological Distress in Palliative Patients
- **Status:** NOT_YET_RECRUITING
- **Study Type:** INTERVENTIONAL
- **Phases:** PHASE2
- **Eligibility:** ALL, 18 Years
- **Locations:** N/A
- **Summary:** The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether psilocybin therapy can effectively treat depression and psychological distress in adult patients with COPD, ALS, MS, or APD who have at least 6 months life expectancy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Can psilocybin therapy safely reduce depressive symptoms compared to low-dose control?
* Will the therapeutic effects be rapid and sustained over a 6-month period?

Researchers will compare patients receiving two escalating doses of psilocybin (15mg followed by 25mg) against those receiving two low doses (1mg) to see if the higher doses lead to greater improvements in depression, anxiety, demoralization, and quality of life.

Participants will:

* Attend three preparation sessions with psychotherapists (1-2 hours each)
* Undergo two supervised psilocybin dosing sessions (6-8 hours each)
* Complete five integration therapy sessions following the dosing sessions
* Participate in follow-up assessments at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months
* Have access to a digital care platform and peer support groups during the 6-month follow-up period
* Optional: Control group participants may receive one high-dose psilocybin session (25mg) after the initial study period

- **NCT ID:** NCT07104916
- **Title:** Mindfulness-based Psilocybin Therapy for PTSD
- **Status:** NOT_YET_RECRUITING
- **Study Type:** INTERVENTIONAL
- **Phases:** PHASE2
- **Eligibility:** ALL, 21 Years
- **Locations:** N/A
- **Summary:** The goal of this study is to learn how psilocybin delivered with mindfulness-based therapy may help symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is an assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled study in participants with PTSD. The study will investigate the changes in brain activity, connectivity, and microstructural neuroplasticity assessed using EEG/EMG and multimodal MRI measures after administration of one oral dose of psilocybin, accompanied either with standard "psychological support" only; or with standard support plus Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT).

- **NCT ID:** NCT05227612
- **Title:** Psilocybin-assisted CBT for Depression
- **Status:** RECRUITING
- **Study Type:** INTERVENTIONAL
- **Phases:** EARLY_PHASE1
- **Eligibility:** ALL, 21 Years
- **Locations:** United States
- **Summary:** The primary objectives of this clinical investigation are to (1) determine the acceptability and feasibility of joining psilocybin-assisted therapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy (PA-CBT) for patients with depression, (2) optimize CBT to most effectively integrate the psilocybin experience with psychotherapy and (3) examine the clinical benefit of psilocybin as an adjunct to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for major depressive disorder.

This study has two phases. Phase I will involve an open trial of PA-CBT where participants will receive two doses of psilocybin (10mg and then 25mg, separated by one month) plus 12 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy. Phase II will be a randomized, two-arm, fixed dose trial that will test the feasibility, acceptability, and participant and therapist adherence to PA-CBT. Both treatment arms will receive two doses of psilocybin (10mg and then 25mg, separated by one month). In Phase II, participants will be randomized (1:1) to either a 12-session PA-CBT or a 6-session standard psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) condition (3 hours of preparation plus 3 hours of supportive therapy integration following the psilocybin experiences).
